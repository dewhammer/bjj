## Image Requirements for Glassmorphism Design

For optimal results with our glassmorphism design:

- Use high-contrast images with good lighting
- Prefer images with clean backgrounds or subtle gradients
- Choose images that work well when partially transparent
- Ensure images have sufficient resolution (minimum 1200px on the longest side)
- Optimize file sizes for web performance (use WebP format when possible)
- Consider how images will appear against dark backgrounds

## Mobile Optimization

To ensure good performance on mobile devices:

- Compress all images appropriately (aim for <200KB per image)
- Provide responsive image sizes where needed
- Use proper aspect ratios to prevent layout shifts
- Ensure important content is visible in center-cropped views
- Test images at various screen sizes and resolutions

## Placeholder Options

Until you have final images, you can:

1. Use stock photos from sites like Unsplash or Pexels
2. Create AI-generated images using tools like DALL-E or Midjourney
3. Use temporary placeholder services like https://placehold.co/ with appropriate dimensions

Remember to replace all placeholder images with actual content before launching the site.
